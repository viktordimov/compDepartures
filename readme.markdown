### Objective
The main purpose of this program is to read a .csv file and to display data from it on an interactive GUI

### To do
- Change single class style to OOP.
- Change the display from full list for the day to next hour only for both `on time` and `delayed` flights.
- Add a timer that updates the displayed flights every 5 minutes
- Optimise reading time (currently it takes about 20 seconds to load) probably through OOP.
